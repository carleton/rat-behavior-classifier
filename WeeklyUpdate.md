#Weekly Updates

## October 11 - 17 2021
- This week we set up DeepLabCut (Conda Environment), JAABA (MatLab) and our Repo onto the psychology lab computer.
- We created a shortcut to simplify starting the DeepLabCut graphical user interface by calling the custom "deeplabcut" function from the computer's terminal.
- We started to add functionality to create batch behaviorFiles for JAABA so that we could avoid having to run our conversion code one video at a time.
