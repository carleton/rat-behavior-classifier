## October 11 - 17 2021

- We created a shortcut to simplify starting the DeepLabCut graphical user interface by calling the custom "deeplabcut" function from the computer's terminal.
- We started to add functionality to create batch behaviorFiles for JAABA so that we could avoid having to run our conversion code one video at a time.

- We added the scripts to the GitHub repo.
